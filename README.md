# AudioTest
 

## Initial Setup

0. Decide which version of Unity you will use.
    - The project is currently set to version 2019.2.12
    - Please discuss with Gene if you want to use a different version
    - Note: I found that TiltBrush model colors become less saturated if you upgrade to version 2019.3.x or higher

1. Browse to the AudioTest project repository at https://github.com/genemiller/AudioTest

2. Clone the AudioTest project repository to your local disk:
    - either
        - click the Code button
        - select Download Zip from the pulldown menu
        - unzip the zip file
    - or
        - sign up for a GitHub account (and tell Gene your GitHub UserID)
        - install Github Desktop on your computer
        - login to Github
        - click the Code button
        - select Open with GitHub Desktop from the pulldown menu.

3. Download the 'Library' folder for this project
    - download from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ceBL0IerwLaevvzjRg9h7Vw9V8x2UVyy?usp=sharing
    - place into AudioTest folder (downloading might take more than an hour)
    - Note: I found this Library is necessary to preserve saturation of TiltBrush model colors.

4. Move the 'Library' folder to the AudioTest project folder

5. Add the AudioTest project to UnityHub

6. Open the AudioTest project (please leave the project set to the value decided by you and Gene)

7. Verify the colors of the TL08_5 TiltBrush model
